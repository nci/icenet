# IceNet: Seasonal Arctic sea ice forecasting with probabilistic deep learing

This repository is forked from the official [Icenet](https://github.com/tom-andersson/icenet-paper). For references and citations, please refer to the official repository.

This codebase accompanies the Nature Communications paper [_Seasonal Arctic sea
ice forecasting with probabilistic deep
learning_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25257-4). It includes code to fully reproduce all the results of the study
from scratch. It also includes code to download
the data generated by the study,
[published on the Polar Data
Centre](https://doi.org/10.5285/71820e7d-c628-4e32-969f-464b7efb187c), and
reproduce all the paper's figures.

The data, model and result files are also available on Gadi storage at `/g/data/wb00/icenet/`. The notebook by default uses the data files from the gadi storage. However, we also provide an option for the user to switch between downloading the data locally. You need to be a memer of the wb00 project to access the data. You may ask to join NCI project wb00 on [mancini](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini).

### Project structure: simplified output from `tree`

Any additional instructions for running the notebook are provided in the notebook itself.
